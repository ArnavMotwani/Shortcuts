### A more useful Shazam shortcut
- This shortcut will shazam a song, show you the song, then give you a choice to save the song's apple music link to a note or to add it to a pre-determined playlist if you want
- A note with "shazam" in the title needs to be in iOS notes for the note fuctionality to work ("shazam" is case sensitive)

### A clipboard shortcut

- To use it copy a link or if you add it to the share sheet you can hold down on a link and then run this shortcut on it.
