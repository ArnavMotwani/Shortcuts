## Introduction

I have made some shortcuts that I use everyday, I decided others might like them so i made this site to share them.

## The shortcuts

### The virtual bookmark (iOS 14) - [iCloud link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b327232d25d14d5d8f95581882703aaa)
- Dependant on WidgetPack (beta app)
- When you run this shortcut it will update a WidgetPack widget with a page number you enter.
- It can be modified to be a count of anything
- Designed to be be a 2x2 widget but it will work as a larger widget (however you might want to increase the font size)

### A quick calendar summary - [iCloud link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/105d0882ef4247a7abeadb30adc247f4)
- This shortcut will give you a quick summary of the day
- Data is taken from iOS calendar

### A more useful Shazam shortcut - [iCloud link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/41944d3cbe3f4e108caf4763c3d300c7)
- This shortcut will shazam a song, show you the song, then give you a choice to save the song's apple music link to a note or to add it to a pre-determined playlist if you want
- A note with "shazam" in the title needs to be in iOS notes for the note functionality to work ("shazam" is case sensitive)

### A clipboard shortcut - [iCloud link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e5e3c749dc114edfb5fe159b05852c65)
- This shortcut allows you to automatically save whats on your clipboard (where things you copy are stored) to a note or clear you clipboard for you.
- To use it copy a link or if you add it to the share sheet you can hold down on a link and then run this shortcut on it.
- A note with "Clipboard" in the title needs to be in iOS notes for the note functionality to work ("Clipboard" is case sensitive)

### Back to your home screen - [iCloud link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c81a17fa850a4cee8fde7e96beadff3a)
- This shortcut is simple but powerful; it takes you to your homepage
- There are many use cases for a shortcut like this. Some use it other shortcuts (such as a Youtube PiP shortcut) but i like to use it with siri, i just say "hey siri, go home" and i reach the homepage. This may seem useless but you'll be surprised how much you may use it

### The verge shortcut - [iCloud link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/0e9e950a430343bea717aeb38dd3bef3)
- Dependant on WidgetPack (beta app)
- This shortcut gets the latest headlines from The Verge (or any other source) and puts it on a widget
- I modified an example widget from WidgetPack to make this shortcut.
- To change the data source, change the rss feed link and change the title to whatever you want
- Designed to be a 4x2 widget (however raise an issue on github if you want me to guide you in making a smaller widget out of it)

*If you have a problem raise an issue on the GitHub repo (the link is on the left on desktop and above on mobile)*
